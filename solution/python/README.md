## Python Juptior Notebook Solution

### Execution of Code:
    1. Notebook:
        - For this solution all you need to do is open the notebook in VS Code and execute.
        - There will be a few on screen out puts and the result data file will be created in your working directory.
    2. Python Execution:
        - From a system with Python installed run 'python Brinton_Code_challenge.py'

### Limitations:
    - I would not chose this format a second time.  Although it was a good experience workign with the data and developing in, there are limitations to the overall structure that are simply bad.  

    - There are options available to create a deliverabel for this solution out of this notebook like Flask, nbconvert or streamlit, none of them are real world options.  I did convert he notebook with nbconvert and made an executable file, but I would not expect it to scale well.
